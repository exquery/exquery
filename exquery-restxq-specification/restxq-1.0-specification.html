      It is unclear yet whether this document will be submitted to the W3C, either
      to the XQuery WG or as Community Group. For the time being it lives under the
      <a href="http://exquery.org/" title="EXQuery: Extensions for EXQuery">EXQuery project</a>.

      Whilst XQuery [[!XQUERY]] was originally envisaged and designed as a query language for XML,
      it has been adopted by many as a language for application development. This specification
      describes a set of XQuery Annotations [[!XQUERY-30]] and a small set of functions to enable XQuery
      to provide RESTful services, thus enabling Web Application development in XQuery.
    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        XQuery processors are now frequently provided as part of complete data application
        processing platforms, which typically incorporate amongst others, XML Data storage
        and Web serving capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        XQuery has long been recognised as a good language for producing XHTML and HTML from
        complex data queries, however XQuery is almost completely ignorant of the Web.
        XQuery provides no native capabilities for either making Web requests or operating
        as a server-side scripting language and processing Web requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of XQuery 3.0, there is still no standard way to create Web Applications in XQuery.
        Many vendors provide extensions to their XQuery implementations which allow users
        to serve web requests using XQuery processing.
        Whilst vendors have borrowed ideas from each other, there is no standard for Web capabilities
        in XQuery, as such developers have to use proprietary extensions, which limits the portability
        of their XQuery code, ultimately fragmenting the XQuery community, limiting re-use and reducing
        peer-learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        RESTXQ attempts to resolve these problem of interoperablility. RESTXQ defines a standard set of
        vendor agnostic XQuery Annotations and functions for XQuery. When implemented by vendors,
        these annotations provide a standard W3C XQuery compliant approach to delivering RESTful
        Web Services from XQuery, whilst the functions provide user convenience for interacting with
        implementations of RESTXQ.
      </p>
      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The guiding goals for the RESTXQ specification are:
          <dl>
            <dt>Interoperability</dt>
              <dd>
                Only features that are already present in XQuery MUST be applied to create RESTXQ.
                Any XQuery code that makes use of RESTXQ instead of vendor extensions, is valid XQuery
                code, and therefore portable. Note that RESTXQ support is required in the XQuery
                processor to execute resource functions in a Web context.
              </dd>
            <dt>Simplicity for XQuery developers</dt>
              <dd>XQuery developers MUST NOT have to maintain external or complex code for wiring RESTful
                services to XQuery functions. Developers should just write standard XQuery.
              </dd>
            <dt>Vendor Agnostic</dt>
              <dd>RESTXQ MUST NOT assume anything about an implementation above what is defined in
                XQuery. RESTXQ MUST be equally implementable by any vendor.
              </dd>
            <dt>Technical improvement</dt>
            <dd>RESTXQ MUST improve on the current approaches, a comprehensive review was undertaken
              <a href="http://www.adamretter.org.uk/papers/restful-xquery_january-2012.pdf" title="RESTful XQuery, Standardised XQuery Annotations for REST">here</a>.

      <section id="audience">
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          This specification is intended for both vendors and developers looking to implement RESTXQ in
          their products, XQuery developers looking to use the RESTXQ features defined in this specification,
          and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of implementations with respect to the requirements
          of this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document assumes that readers already have at least a basic understanding of XQuery, and
          an understanding of Web technologies and server side scripting.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Namespaces and Prefixes</h3>
        <p>
          The annotations and functions discussed in this document are contained in
          namespaces (see [[!XML-NAMES]]) and referenced using an xs:QName:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>http://exquery.org/ns/restxq</code>, associated with <code>rest</code>.</li>
          <li><code>http://www.w3.org/2010/xslt-xquery-serialization</code>, associated with <code>output</code>.</li>
          <li><code>http://expath.org/ns/http-client</code>, associated with <code>http</code>.</li>
          <li><code>http://exquery.org/ns/restxq/error</code>, associated with <code>rerr</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The namespace prefix used for the functions, datatypes and errors can vary, as
          long as the prefix is bound to the correct URI.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          The namespace URI associated with the <code>rerr</code> prefix is not expected to change from one version of this document to another. The contents of this namespace may be extended to allow additional errors to be returned.
        </div>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="annotations">
      <h2>Annotations</h2>

      <section id="annotations-background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          RESTXQ is heavily influenced by [[!JAX-RS]]. However, we simplify and deviate from JAX-RS
          predominantly due to the language structure differences between Java and XQuery. Where JAX-RS describes Resource Classes
          and Resources Methods for Java, in XQuery we simply use the term Resource Function; for mapping HTTP calls
          to XQuery invocation, our unit of granularity is the XQuery function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the use of annotations on functions in XQuery, we declaratively mark-up the HTTP capabilities
          of a function. To minimise refactoring by developers when adding annotations to existing code, two measures
          must be respected by implementations:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Implementations of RESTXQ MUST support annotated functions which have additional
            function parameters which are not annotation mapped, providing the cardinality type
            of those un-mapped parameters accepts an empty sequence.
          </li>
          <li>Implementors MUST not enforce the order of function parameters. Whether mapped
            by annotations or not is unimportant, as annotations explicitly name the parameters
            to which they are mapped.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="resource-functions">
      <h3>Resource Functions</h3>
      <p>
        A Resource Function is an XQuery function which has been marked up with RESTXQ annotations.
        These annotations indicate to a processor that when presented with a RESTful web service
        request, that matches the constraints indicated by the annotations, that the function
        SHOULD be invoked and the result SHOULD be returned as the result of the service request.
      </p>
      <p>There are two types of Resource Function Annotations described in RESTXQ:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Constraints (<a href="#resource-function-constraints" class="sectionRef"></a>)</li>
        <li>Parameters (<a href="#resource-function-parameters" class="sectionRef"></a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <section id="templates">
        <h4>Templates</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the RESTXQ Annotations make use of Templates, which allow for the substitution of parameters
          from the request into the query. The syntax of these templates is very simple and is designed to be
          familiar to existing XQuery developers, it is expressed in <a href="#template-grammar" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>The Template appears inside a string literal within the annotation, but the meaning is that the
          value of the templated substitution MUST be used as the parameter to the named argument of the
          annotated function.</p>
        <pre class="example highlight" title="Template">
          {$number-of-cats}
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, a parameter given from the template substitution MUST be
          set for the function argument called 'number-of-cats' on the annotated function.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="resource-function-constraints">
        <h4>Resource Function Constraints</h4>
        <p>Constraints restrict the service requests that a Resource Function MAY process.</p>
        <section id="path-annotation">
          <h5>Path Annotation</h5>
          <p>
            A Path Annotation maps the URI of a RESTful web service to a Resource Function
            and provides for path templates.
          </p>
          <p> <!-- TODO also consider allowing zero or more path annotations -->
            A Resource Function MUST contain a single path annotation. Additional annotations
            MAY be used to constrain or parameterize the Resource Function.
          </p>
          <p>
            The path annotation is named <code>%rest:path</code> and takes a single
            mandatory literal string, which describes the URI path for this service.
            The URI path is considered relative to an implementation-defined base URI
            (<a href="#base-uri" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The path string MAY contain zero or more URI templates which denote path
            segments that MUST map to named function parameters. Parameters addressed by
            templates in the URI path must meet the following constraints:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <!-- TODO describe error codes -->
              The cardinality MUST allow for an atomic value, otherwise an error should be raised by the
              implementation, i.e., it must not be of type empty-sequence().</li>
            <li>
              <!-- TODO describe error codes -->
              The type MUST inherit from xs:anyAtomicType, otherwise, an error should be raised by the implementation.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <!-- TODO describe type conversion -->
            Conversion from the URI segment string to the required type is performed
            at run-time, and an error MUST be raised if conversion is impossible.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Path Annotation">
            declare
              %rest:path("/stock/widget/{$id}")
            function local:widget($id as xs:int) {
              fn:collection("/db/widgets")//widget[@id = $id]
            };
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the above example, an HTTP GET on the following URI would cause the widget
            with the <code>id</code> of '1981' to be retrieved:
            <code>http://www.widget-factory.com/stock/widget/{$id}</code>.
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            When many Resource Functions are defined, there can be many Path Annotations.
            As such, conflicts may occur, the resolution of such conflicts MUST be processed
            as described in <a href="#path-preference"></a>.
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="method-annotation">
          <h5>Method Annotation</h5>
          <p>
            Resource Functions MAY be constrained to zero or more HTTP methods by means of
            a method annotation. Unless otherwise constrained by a method annotation,
            the path annotation of a Resource Function applies to all HTTP methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Annotations are defined for all HTTP 1.1 methods except TRACE and CONNECT.
            All methods MAY return resources except for HEAD, which must only return a
            <code>rest:response</code> element.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Method Annotation">
            declare
              %rest:DELETE
              %rest:path("/widget/{$id}")
            function local:widget($id as xs:int) {
              delete node fn:collection("/db/widgets")//widget[@id = $id]
            };
          </pre>
          <p>
            The method annotations <code>POST</code> and <code>PUT</code> may take an
            optional string literal which maps the HTTP request body to a named function
            parameter. The same syntax as that used for URI templates is applied.
            For example
            <code>%rest:POST("{$request-body")</code> would inject the request body into
            the function through the function parameter named 'request-body'. The
            function parameter for the request body must meet the following constraints:
            <ol>
              <li>
                The cardinality MUST allow for one or more of the typed item(s).
              </li>
              <li>
                The type MUST be compatible with the request body. The type of the request
                body is determined by the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header and may be
                constrained by means of the <code>%rest:consumes</code> annotation. The
                interpretation of the request body is similar to that of the
                <a href="http://expath.org/spec/http-client">EXPath HTTP Client</a>:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    If the Media Type ([[IANA-MEDIA-TYPES]]) indicated by the <code>Content-Type</code> header
                    matches <code>text/*</code> (excluding <code>text/xml</code>),
                    the function parameter type will be <code>xs:string</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the Media Type indicated by the <code>Content-Type</code> header
                    is of an XML type, the request body is parsed as XML and
                    the function parameter type will be <code>document-node()</code>.

        <p>
          Parameters to Resource Functions are extracted from the RESTful Web Service
          request and passed in as additional function parameters. Unlike constraints,
          parameters are always optional. Resource Function Parameters use the
          <a href="#templates">template</a> syntax to map the request parameter onto
          a function parameter. They may also provide a default value should the
          parameter not be present in the request. Resource Function Parameters always
          place the following constraints on the function parameters that they map to:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The cardinality MUST allow for zero or many atomic values in the case of
              <a href="#query-param-annotation">Query</a>,
              <a href="#form-param-annotation">Form</a> or

              atomic value in the case of <a href="#cookie-param-annotation">Cookie</a>
              parameters, otherwise an error MUST be raised by the implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The type MUST inherit from xs:anyAtomicType, otherwise, an error MUST
              be raised by the implementation.

      <h2>Response</h2>

      <section id="serialization">
        <h3>Serialization</h3>
        <p>
          The results of a Resource Function may be serialized back to an HTTP
          response for the RESTful web service response.
          A Resource Function may return one of three response types:
          <ol>
            <li> A Resource, i.e. just content.</li>
            <li> HTTP headers, for example acknowledging the request or providing a status
                 code or additional information.</li>
            <li> Both HTTP Headers and a Resource</li>
          </ol>

          The XQuery Specification states in
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30/#id-serialization">Section 2.2.4</a>
          how the result of a query is serialized. Serialization may be controlled by
          the use of Output Declarations. In RESTXQ, the following rules are applied:

          <ol>
            <li>
              If the function is from within a Main Module, and if an output declaration
              exists, then we use this as the <dfn>default serialization</dfn> settings
              for each Resource Function in that module.
            </li>
            <li>
              Output Declarations may be re-written as annotations on any Resource
              Function, e.g. <code>%output:method("xml")</code>. These annotation output
              declarations override any defaults from <a href="#dfn-default-serialization">1</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If no Output Declaration, annotated or otherwise, is provided, then the
              default is to serialize as XML, UTF-8 encoding, with indenting.
            </li>
          </ol>

          Each of the three possible result types of a Resource Function needs to be
          handled in a different manner by an implementation, and as such we provide
          appropriate function signature restrictions, and detail how annotations
          interact with these:

          <ol>
            <li>
              For a function that returns just a resource, either:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If the result type is omitted from the function, it is assumed to be
                  <code>document-node(element())</code> or just <code>element()</code>,
                  and XML Serialization should be applied to the result of the function.
                  The annotation <code>%output:method</code>, if present,
                  MUST be set to <code>xml</code>. This is known as the
                  <dfn>Default Resource Response rule</dfn>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the result type is present, it MUST be a type which is compatible with
                  the chosen serialization method, defined by either the XQuery output
                  declaration or overridden by the <code>%output:method</code> annotation on
                  the Resource Function. The default serialization method is XML.
                  If the result type is not compatible with the serialization,
                  an implementation MUST throw an error. This is known as the
                  <dfn>Typed Resource Response rule</dfn>.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              For a function that returns just HTTP headers, the result type of the function
              MUST be defined as <code>document-node(element(rest:response))</code>.
              Any other annotations that effect the serialization of the result are ignored.
            </li>
            <li>
              For a function that returns both HTTP headers and a resource, the result type
              of the function MUST be defined as <code>item()+</code>. The first item in the
              result sequence is the HTTP headers i.e.
              <code>document-node(element(rest:response)</code>, the second item in the
              result sequence is the resource itself; Subsequently both the
              <a>Default Resource Response rule</a> and the
              <a>Typed Resource Response rule</a> MUST be applied to the result sequence.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="response-format">
        <h3>Response Format</h3>
        <p>
          A REST Response document may be returned from a function either with or without
          a Resource. The purpose of this document is to control the REST (in this case HTTP)
          response sent back to the client of the RESTful web service.
        </p>

        <pre class="highlight note" title="Syntax of Response Format">
&lt;rest:response&gt;
  (http:response?)
&lt;/rest:response&gt;

&lt;http:response status?="integer" message?="string"&gt;
  (http:header*)
&lt;/http:response&gt;

&lt;http:header name="string" value="string"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>
          Should the status be omitted for the response, or should a REST Response
          document not be returned from a Resource Function, then the status defaults to
          200 OK. It is expected that implementations will make use of sane defaults for
          HTTP headers as part of their HTTP responses, however any default headers MUST
          be overridable by the values set in the REST Response document.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an example, the following response can be returned to trigger a
          client-side redirection:
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Client-Side Redirection">
&lt;rest:response&gt;

          <p>
            Summary: This function returns the implementation-defined base URI
            (<a href="#base-uri" class="sectionRef"></a>) of the Resource Function.

          <p>
            Summary: This function returns the complete URI that addresses the Resource Function. Typically
            this is the <code>rest:base-uri()</code> appended with the path from the Path Annotation (if present) of the Resource Function.

      <h2>Resources for Implementers</h2>
      <p>
        If you plan to implement RESTXQ, there is already a set of common abstraction libraries written in Java
        which should significantly reduce the ammount of effort involved and avoid re-inventing more wheels. You need
        just implement a few interfaces and adapters. For more information see the
        <a href="http://www.github.com/exquery/exquery" title="EXQuery GitHub">EXQuery GitHub page</a>.

      <h2>Annotation Template Grammar</h2>
      <p>The grammar used for RESTXQ Templates is expressed in EBNF and re-uses the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30/#prod-xquery30-EQName" title="EQName">EQName</a> from the XQuery grammar</p>
